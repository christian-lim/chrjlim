                I actually had plenty of free time over my winter break to pursue my new year-long commitment. So, I decided to start this shindig a little early.
                I started off just doing some sketches about how I wanted the site to generally look like, as well as what framework I wanted to use, how I wanted to host the site,
                and briefly brainstormed additional projects I wanted to try out. I went a little gungho, however, and finished the site before the new year started. 
                However, there was still the matter of who's hosting the site, as well as preliminary preparation for my next month's project. It's much more ambitious, and 
                so I'm planning on reaping the extra couple of weeks for some refreshers.

                I decided to use Django for development, the main reason being that I simply love the intuitive and convenient nature of the framework.
                I am also planning on hooking the backend up with AWS to gain some exposure on interacting with cloud platforming. I hope that this brief stint 
                can benefit me as my upcoming workplace is all about AWS, and only AWS.
